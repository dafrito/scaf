Generate blank scaffolds for source files, licenses, etc.

## .scafrc files

Many scaffolds use variables that may vary by project. For example, the
autogenerated license for a work-related project should be different than a
personal project. .scafrc files are plain shell scripts allow that are
automatically loaded to allow project-specific variation to occur.

.scafrc files come from two locations: hard-coded default paths (/etc/scafrc and
~/.scafrc), and relative to the current working directory. .scafrc's are used if
they exist in the current working directory or any parent directory, and they
are loaded parent-first. In this way, a specific directory can use its parent's
settings and it only needs to provide its overrides.

### Supported overrides

Here's the current list of variables that can be overridden in .scafrc files:

* MODELINE: The Vim modeline to add to most generated files.
* OWNER: The "legal" owner of the file (e.g. the organization, the individual)

vim: set tw=80 :
